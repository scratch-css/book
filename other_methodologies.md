### Other methodologies

In most of cases, if you use Scratch, you don't need to use something else, since it provides everything app may needs. But still, you can mix it with them if you wish so. But you should consider naming conflicts of variables with your current code base, as well as reset.

Here are little research about other well-known methodologies in CSS. I compared them with Scratch and also indicated whether it's possible to mix with them.
