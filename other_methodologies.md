# Other methodologies

In most of cases, if you use Scratch, you don't need to use something else, since it provides everything app may needs. But still, you can mix it with them if you wish so. But you must consider naming conflicts of variables with your current code base, as well as reset.css file.

Here I made some research about other well-known methodologies in CSS. I compared them with Scratch and also indicated whether it's possible to mix with them or not.

### List of other methodologies:
- [BEM CSS](bem.html) - Block Element Modifier
- [SMACSS](smacss.html) - Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
- [OOCSS](oocss.html) - Object Oriented CSS
- [SuitCSS](suitcss.html) - Styling methodology for component-based UI development
- [~~Systematic CSS~~](systematic_css.html) - Simpler alterative to existing CSS methodologies
- [Atomic](https://acss.io/) - CSS for component-base frameworks
