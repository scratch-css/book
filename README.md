# Scratch framework
 Scratch is CSS framework and methodology to build web, mobile and TV applications with one code base. We have micro modular architecture, so you choose what you really want to take. Using it means to follow some good practices, make everything configurable and easy to change. We have some built-in features as well as some additional modules you may also want to use.

By default, you can manage: 
 * Colors
 * Units
 * Responsive breakpoints
 * Typography set
 * Gutters (or gaps)
 * Writing directions
 * Reset

We also have other libraries to enhance its possibilities:
 * [Grid system](https://github.com/scratch-css/grid) - two types of grid system.
 * [UI kit](https://github.com/scratch-css/ui) - rich library of UI components.
 * [Helpers](https://github.com/scratch-css/helpers) - helper classes to use inline in HTML.

They are based on Scratch, and are great examples of using it. You have all separated on `npm`, or you can use them [all together](https://github.com/scratch-css/all).
