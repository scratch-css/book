### Naming

I believe every CSS developer can have own taste of writing it besides some standards. We don't restrict your conventions, you can still stick to your current one. Scratch will still work. Main rule is to be simple and beautiful. But I prefer:

#### CSS
- Dashes (`-`) instead of `TitleCase` or `camelCase`.
- Full names (`header-shadow`) instead of abbreviations or any shorten names (`head-shad`).

#### HTML
- Separate class names by group in HTML with pipe (```class="products | flexible row padding-big"```).
