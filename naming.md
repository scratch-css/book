### Naming

We believe every CSS developer can have own taste of writing it besides some standards. We don't restrict your conventions, you can still stick to your current one, but we prefer:

 * Dashes (`-`) instead of `TitleCase` or `camelCase`.
 * Full names (`header-shadow`) instead of abbreviations or any shorten names (`head-shad`).
 *
