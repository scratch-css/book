### Features

Scratch provides management system for these fields:

- Colors
- Units
- Responsive breakpoints
- Typography set
- Gutters (or gaps)
- Writing directions
- Reset

We also have other libraries to enhance its possibilities:

- [Grid system](https://github.com/scratch-css/grid) - two types of grid system.
- [UI kit](https://github.com/scratch-css/ui) - rich library of UI components.
- [Helpers](https://github.com/scratch-css/helpers) - helper classes to use inline in HTML.
- [Animations](https://github.com/scratch-css/animations) - CSS animations and transitions.

They are based on Scratch, and are great examples of using it. You have all separated on `npm`, or you can use them [all together](https://github.com/scratch-css/all). 

You can read more in [Modules](modules.html) page.
